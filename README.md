# Loan_mortgage_analysis
Worked with a company in the Bay Area to analyze their loan mortgage data. Analysis includes the prediction of loan processing time.
Regression and classification models are used to predict the time it takes 
from the mortgage rate "locked" until the money gets "funded" (it's called "Locked to Funded" time).
