# Loan_mortgage_analysis
Worked with a company in the Bay Area to analyze their loan mortgage data. Analysis includes the prediction of loan processing time.
Regression models are used to predict the # of days 
from the mortgage rate "locked" until the money gets "funded" (it's called "Locked to Funded" time).
Classification models are used to predict the Locked to Funded "period" after the data were divided 
into several different bins (Lock periods).
Top features were found and interpretations were made.
